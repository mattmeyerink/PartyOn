# Party On

This repo contains a collection of scripts I created to make life
easier! Currently all scripts are written in Python and can be 
executed in the terminal.

## Download

To use these scrpits you will first need to clone this repo. Make 
sure you have git installed and are in the correct folder then run the following command in the 
CLI of your choice.

`git clone https://github.com/mattmeyerink/PartyOn.git`

## Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your device. Then navigate 
into the root of the PartyOn folder in your CLI and run the following 
command.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This should kick off an installation of all the required software for these scripts.

## Running the scripts

Each script is isolated in its own file. To run a script, navigate to 
the root of the PartyOn folder in your CLI and run the following command 
replacing <FILENAME> with the name of the file you would like to run. 

`python3 <FILENAME>`

Ex: To run the keepThePartyRolling script run `python3 keepThePartyRolling.py`.
